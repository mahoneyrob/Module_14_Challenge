#Citi Bikes 

##Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze the data for Citi Bike in New York City, so that you can try to open a similar business in Des Moines, Iowa.  We look at the public data for August of 2019 that is published by Citi Bikes.

##Results
The results are displayed in the Tableau Story named citibikes_project.

##Summary
2 additional visualizations are displayed in the story.  The main additional analysis I would run has more to do with Des Moines demographics to get an idea if people would use bike to commute to work, as this seems to be the predominate use of the bikes in New York.
